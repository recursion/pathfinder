This is a very simple react application that demos a simple A* pathfinding algorithm. At least partially inspired by: [this awesome pathfinding app](https://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/).

Demo available at: https://js-path-finder.surge.sh

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Instructions

Move the source (red) or destination (blue) square, and then click on the new square to move it to a new location. 

Click (and drag) on any green square to create a Wall (grey square). Click (and drag) on any grey square to create an empty (green location).

## Issues/Todo
[ ] Currently cannot stop an active pathfind with the reset button.
[ ] Would be nice to provide more visual feedback about currently searched paths. A variety of options exist here. See: https://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/
[ ] Make a nice, full screen interface, with variable size tile options.
[ ] Add other pathfinding algos.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
